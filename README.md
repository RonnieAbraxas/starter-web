# Starter Web Repo

This repository is for showing how Git and GitHub work

## Purpose

Sample website with plenty of files for demos

## My 2 cents

I'm adding my own two cents here because that's all I can afford.

## Deployment

I would prefer deployment to employment if I had UBI. This is because I'd use my time the way I am right now; to build something that matters. Then I wouldn't need a job to have value as a human being. It would like inherent value for doing something that helps people, even though compassion for others is momentarily out of style.
