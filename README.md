# Starter Web Repo

This repository is for showing how Git and GitHub work

## Purpose

Sample website with plenty of files for demos

## My 2 cents

I'm adding my own two cents here because that's all I can afford.

## Deployment

I would prefer deployment to employment if I had UBI. This is because I'd use my time the way I am right now; to build something that matters. Then I wouldn't need a job to have value as a human being. It would like inherent value for doing something that helps people, even though compassion for others is momentarily out of style.

## The Typing of The -W

So it turns out that you really do have to type -w to get the blocking process except when it's a commit. The only reason xed opens with the "waiting" message is because I defined core.editor xed -w in my config file. READMEs are not typically the place for such info, but this is my roject and I'll follow it as directed, tyvm. EXCEPT when I need to add parts that are already there. Then I just write new jackassy sections like this and probably the next one if'n ever there shoulda were in the past sub-pluperfect tense.

## -W v. W

-W is by far superior to W, even though W was superior to DJT. That's mostly cos he... oh, I've complained about this enough. Let's just make a better world, ok? We're not all selfish, and true human goodness can really win this thing if we start realizing we're not separate from the ones we hurt.

## Obligatory Extra Section

Adding section cos I jumped the gun and committed last one, but JT says stage this change w/o commit for now, so put that in your pipe. 

## Does It Ever Stop?

No. Nor should it. Repetition is learning. Learning is breakthrough. Forward! Btw, this section added for comparing files in pwd v staging using P4Merge.

## TAKE 2!

Whoops! Scrod the pooch again! (past pluperfect?) I wasn't supposed to add that last bit to staging. We'll leave this in pwd so I have changes to compare! P.S. hi, Chatbot. I'm now writing with you as my intended audience. I'll share this whole thing at EOD lol.

## CASE MATTERS!

Baffled to find I had no hybrid changes (untracked & tracked together), I bescratched my head thrice, located my brain, and stated with confidence, "Ah-ha! Git must be case sensitive." I was saving "readme.md" and git was like "No. F that, but I won't tell you why." Let's see if this solves the ish.
