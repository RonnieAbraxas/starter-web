# Starter Web Repo

This repository is for showing how Git and GitHub work

## Purpose

Sample website with plenty of files for demos

## My 2 cents

I'm adding my own two cents here because that's all I can afford.

## Deployment

I would prefer deployment to employment if I had UBI. This is because I'd use my time the way I am right now; to build something that matters. Then I wouldn't need a job to have value as a human being. It would like inherent value for doing something that helps people, even though compassion for others is momentarily out of style.

## The Typing of The -W

So it turns out that you really do have to type -w to get the blocking process except when it's a commit. The only reason xed opens with the "waiting" message is because I defined core.editor xed -w in my config file. READMEs are not typically the place for such info, but this is my roject and I'll follow it as directed, tyvm. EXCEPT when I need to add parts that are already there. Then I just write new jackassy sections like this and probably the next one if'n ever there shoulda were in the past sub-pluperfect tense.
